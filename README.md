# ForgetMeNot
This is a journaling web-app that will allow you to journal about your day. The main separation from this project against  other projects is that it will give you a recap of your day so you can link/reference these events in your journaling.

# Future Features
- Allow for Rich Text Fields that are integrated with Vue.js
- Gather information about the user's day to give an intelligent recap 
- Improve storing/sharing of journaling events
